# Code samples for "log linear model"

1.Project Structure:
	./LogLinearModel.py: the first version of the log linear model
	./LogLinearModel_factor.py: the log linear model with the regularization factor
	./LogLinearModel_factor_optimized.py: the optimized log linear model for speeding up
	./train.conll: the training data
	./dev.conll: the development data
	./result.txt: the program result on my computer
	./README.md: something about the project

2.How to run the program?
	There are three independent codes and you can run them all.
	To run these codes, you should prepare these following things:
	python2.7
	2.1 to run:
		./LogLinearModel.py
		./LogLinearModel_factor.py
		./LogLinearModel_factor_optimized.py

You can run all the projects and compare them with the precision and executing time.
